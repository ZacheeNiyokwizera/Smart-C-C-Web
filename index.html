                            or office you require deep cleaning services. A deep clean is suitable for 
                            a very dirty home that has not been cleaned in a while. You may be moving into a home where the previous occupants kept the home in a very dirty state,  a deep clean is suitable in such situations. If there are grease marks on walls, spilt oils, dirt and grime behind your stove, tough stains in shower tiles and 
                            glasses, then you need a deep clean. It includes cleaning of all windows,
                             cleaning of inside cupboards and shelves, cleaning of fridges and ovens, cleaning of mould off walls.Our deep cleaning is a once off clean that is very thorough and we ensure to clean all those hard to reach areas of your home or office.

                            When you have a tough and stubborn stain on your carpet, then our carpet cleaning offering is for you. Our methods remove all dirt embedded deep down in the carpets and we leave your carpets fresh and dry in no time. We use a deep carpet penetrating steam cleaning  method which ensures hot water penetrates deep into the carpet fibres and the high pressure suction pump sucks up the moisture which lifts up the dirt and dust mites from deep inside the carpet fibres. The cleaning suction action cleaning is reinforced by our germ killing and environmentally friendly chemicals which are dissolved in the hot water used for cleaning.  We are also experts at cleaning upholstery ranging from couches, chairs, mattresses, ottomans and upholstery seats.
