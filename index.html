                            occupants kept the home in a very dirty state, a deep clean is suitable in such situations. If there are grease marks on walls, spilt oils, dirt and grime behind your stove, tough stains in shower tiles and glasses, then you
                            need a deep clean. It includes cleaning of all windows, cleaning of inside cupboards and shelves, cleaning of fridges and ovens, cleaning of mould off walls.Our deep cleaning is a once off clean that is very thorough and we

                            cleaning method which ensures hot water penetrates deep into the carpet fibres and the high pressure suction pump sucks up the moisture which lifts up the dirt and dust mites from deep inside the carpet fibres. The cleaning
                            suction action cleaning is reinforced by our germ killing and environmentally friendly chemicals which are dissolved in the hot water used for cleaning. We are also experts at cleaning upholstery ranging from couches, chairs,
                            mattresses, ottomans and upholstery seats.
